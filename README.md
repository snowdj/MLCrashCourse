# MLCrashCourse
Julia files inspired by Google's Machine Learning Crash Course

The files in this repository reproduce most of the programming exercises in Google's Machine Learning Crash Course (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) using Tensorflow.jl (https://github.com/malmaud/TensorFlow.jl). An accompanying blog can be found at https://tensorflowjulia.blogspot.com.

Currently, Julia v0.6.3 is used. The files will hopefully be updated to support Julia v1.0 as soon the packages used in the notebooks support the latest version of Julia.
